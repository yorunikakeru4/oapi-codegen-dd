# `oapi-codegen`

[![OpenSSF Best Practices](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/9450/badge)](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/9450)

> **Battle-tested**: This generator is continuously tested against 2,000+ real-world OpenAPI specs, successfully generating and compiling over 20 million lines of Go code. Handles complex specs with circular references, deep nesting, and union types.

Using `oapi-codegen` allows you to reduce the boilerplate required to create or integrate with
services based on [OpenAPI 3.x](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.0.md), and instead focus on writing your business logic, and working
on the real value-add for your organisation.

With `oapi-codegen`, there are a few [Key Design Decisions](#key-design-decisions) we've made, 
including:

- idiomatic Go, where possible
- fairly simple generated code, erring on the side of duplicate code over nicely refactored code
- supporting as much of OpenAPI 3.x as is possible, alongside Go's type system


## Migrate from v2

This project is a fork of [oapi-codegen](https://github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen) v2.  
Due to the lack of OpenAPI 3.1 support in the original repository, we introduced a fully reworked implementation.  
While this includes some breaking changes, it also brings more flexible generator and parser APIs for finer control over code generation.  
If you're migrating from v2, please refer to the [migration guide](docs/migrate-from-v2.md) for important differences.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
go install github.com/yorunikakeru4/oapi-codegen-dd/v3/cmd/oapi-codegen@latest

# Generate code from the Petstore example
oapi-codegen https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/main/examples/v3.0/petstore.yaml > petstore.go
```

## Usage

`oapi-codegen` is largely configured using a YAML configuration file, to simplify the number of
flags that users need to remember, and to make reading the `go:generate` command less daunting.

## Features

At a high level, `oapi-codegen` supports:

- Generating the types ([docs](#generating-api-models))
- Splitting large OpenAPI specs across multiple packages([docs](#import-mapping))
  - This is also known as "Import Mapping" or "external references" across our documentation / discussion in GitHub issues


## Key design decisions

- Produce an interface that can be satisfied by your implementation, with reduced boilerplate
- Bulk processing and parsing of OpenAPI document in Go
- Resulting output is using Go's `text/template`s, which are user-overridable
- Attempts to produce Idiomatic Go
- Single or multiple file output
- Support of OpenAPI 3.1
- Extract parameters from requests, to reduce work required by your implementation
- Implicit `additionalProperties` are ignored by default ([more details](#additional-properties-additionalproperties))
- Prune unused types by default



## Generating API models

If you're looking to only generate the models for interacting with a remote service, 
for instance if you need to hand-roll the API client for whatever reason, you can do this as-is.

> [!TIP]
> Try to define as much as possible within the `#/components/schemas` object, as `oapi-codegen` 
> will generate all the types here.
>
> Although we can generate some types based on inline definitions in i.e. a path's response type, 
> it isn't always possible to do this, or if it is generated, can be a little awkward to work 
> with as it may be defined as an anonymous struct.


## OpenAPI extensions

As well as the core OpenAPI support, we also support the following OpenAPI extensions, 
as denoted by the [OpenAPI Specification Extensions](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3#specification-extensions).

`x-go-type` <br>
`x-go-type-import`

</td>

Override the generated type definition (and optionally, add an import from another package)
</td>
<td>
<details>

Using the `x-go-type` (and optionally, `x-go-type-import` when you need to import another package)
allows overriding the type that `oapi-codegen` determined the generated type should be.

We can see this at play with the following schemas:

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Client:
      type: object
      required:
        - name
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        id:
          type: number
    ClientWithExtension:
      type: object
      required:
        - name
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
          # this is a bit of a contrived example, as you could instead use
          # `format: uuid` but it explains how you'd do this when there may be
          # a clash, for instance if you already had a `uuid` package that was
          # being imported, or ...
          x-go-type: googleuuid.UUID
          x-go-type-import:
            path: github.com/google/uuid
            name: googleuuid
        id:
          type: number
          # ... this is also a bit of a contrived example, as you could use
          # `type: integer` but in the case that you know better than what
          # oapi-codegen is generating, like so:
          x-go-type: int64
```

From here, we now get two different models:

```go
// Client defines model for Client.
type Client struct {
	Id   *float32 `json:"id,omitempty"`
	Name string   `json:"name"`
}

// ClientWithExtension defines model for ClientWithExtension.
type ClientWithExtension struct {
	Id   *int64          `json:"id,omitempty"`
	Name googleuuid.UUID `json:"name"`
}
```

`x-go-type-skip-optional-pointer`

Do not add a pointer type for optional fields in structs

<details>

By default, `oapi-codegen` will generate a pointer for optional fields.

Using the `x-go-type-skip-optional-pointer` extension allows omitting that pointer.

We can see this at play with the following schemas:

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Client:
      type: object
      required:
        - name

Override the generated name of a field or a type

<details>

By default, `oapi-codegen` will attempt to generate the name of fields and types in as best a way 
it can.

However, sometimes, the name doesn't quite fit what your codebase standards are, or the intent 
of the field, so you can override it with `x-go-name`.

We can see this at play with the following schemas:

```yaml
openapi: "3.0.0"

By default, `oapi-codegen` will generate `json:"..."` struct tags for all fields in a struct, so JSON (un)marshaling works.

However, sometimes, you want to omit fields, which can be done with the `x-go-json-ignore` extension.

We can see this at play with the following schemas:

`x-sensitive-data`

<td>
Automatically mask sensitive data in JSON output
</td>
<td>
<details>

The `x-sensitive-data` extension allows you to mark fields as containing sensitive information that should be automatically masked when marshaling to JSON. This is useful for preventing accidental logging or exposure of sensitive data like passwords, API keys, credit card numbers, etc.

The extension supports several masking strategies:

- **`full`**: Replace the entire value with a fixed-length mask (`"********"`) to hide both content and length
- **`regex`**: Mask only parts of the value matching a regex pattern (keeps context visible)
- **`hash`**: Replace the value with a SHA256 hash (one-way, useful for verification)
- **`partial`**: Mask the middle part while keeping prefix/suffix visible (e.g., show last 4 digits of credit card)

Example:

```yaml
openapi: "3.0.0"
info:
  version: 1.0.0
  title: Sensitive Data Example
components:
  schemas:
    User:
      type: object
      properties:
        email:
          type: string
          x-sensitive-data:
            mask: full
        ssn:
          type: string
          x-sensitive-data:
            mask: regex
            pattern: '\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}'
        creditCard:
          type: string
          x-sensitive-data:
            mask: partial
            keepSuffix: 4  # Show last 4 digits
        apiKey:
          type: string
          x-sensitive-data:
            mask: hash
            algorithm: sha256
```

This generates:

```go
type User struct {
    Email      *string `json:"email,omitempty" sensitive:""`
    Ssn        *string `json:"ssn,omitempty" sensitive:""`
    CreditCard *string `json:"creditCard,omitempty" sensitive:""`
    ApiKey     *string `json:"apiKey,omitempty" sensitive:""`
}

func (u User) MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error) {
    // Custom marshaler that masks sensitive fields
    // ...
}
```

When marshaling to JSON:
- `email: "user@example.com"` becomes `email: "********"` (fixed length, hides original length)
- `ssn: "123-45-6789"` becomes `ssn: "***-**-****"` (digits masked, structure visible)
- `creditCard: "1234-5678-9012-3456"` becomes `creditCard: "********3456"` (last 4 visible)
- `apiKey: "my-secret-key"` becomes `apiKey: "325ededd6c3b9988f623c7f964abb9b016b76b0f8b3474df0f7d7c23b941381f"` (SHA256 hash)

**Partial masking options:**
- `keepPrefix`: Number of characters to keep at the start
- `keepSuffix`: Number of characters to keep at the end

Override generated variable names for enum constants

<details>

When consuming an enum value from an external system, the name may not produce a nice variable name. 
Using the `x-enum-names` extension allows overriding the name of the generated variable names.

We can see this at play with the following schemas:

```yaml
openapi: "3.0.0"
info:
  version: 1.0.0

From here, we now get two different forms of the same enum definition.

```go
// Defines values for ClientType.
const (
	ACT ClientType = "ACT"
	EXP ClientType = "EXP"
)

// ClientType defines model for ClientType.
type ClientType string

          # NOTE that this doesn't generate, as no `deprecated: true` is set
          x-deprecated-reason: NOTE you shouldn't see this, as you've not deprecated this field
```

From here, we now get two different forms of the same enum definition.

```go
// Client defines model for Client.
type Client struct {
	Id   *float32 `json:"id,omitempty"`
	Name string   `json:"name"`
}

// ClientWithExtension defines model for ClientWithExtension.
type ClientWithExtension struct {
	Id *float32 `json:"id,omitempty"`
	// Deprecated: Don't use because reasons
	Name string `json:"name"`
}
```

Notice that because we've not set `deprecated: true` to the `name` field, it doesn't generate 
a deprecation warning.

## Custom code generation

It is possible to extend the inbuilt code generation from `oapi-codegen` using 
Go's `text/template`s.

You can specify, through your configuration file, the `user-templates` setting to override 
the inbuilt templates and use a user-defined template.

> [!NOTE]
> Filenames given to the `user-templates` configuration must **exactly** match the filename 
> that `oapi-codegen` is looking for

### Local paths

Within your configuration file, you can specify relative or absolute paths to a file to 
reference for the template, such as:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/doordash/oapi-codegen/HEAD/configuration-schema.json
# ...
user-templates:
  client.tmpl: ./custom-template.tmpl
  enums.tmpl: /tmp/foo.bar
  types.tmpl: no-prefix.tmpl
```

### Using the Go package

You can get full control of the generator and the parser by using the `codegen` package directly.

TBD: add documentation

## Additional Properties (`additionalProperties`)

[OpenAPI Schemas](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3.html#schema-object) implicitly accept `additionalProperties`, meaning that any fields 
provided, but not explicitly defined via properties on the schema are accepted as input, 
and propagated. 
When unspecified, OpenAPI defines that the `additionalProperties` field is assumed to be `true`.

For simplicity, and to remove a fair bit of duplication and boilerplate, 
`oapi-codegen` decides to ignore the implicit `additionalProperties: true`,
and instead requires you to specify the `additionalProperties` key to generate the boilerplate.

Below you can see some examples of how `additionalProperties` affects the generated code.

### Implicit `additionalProperties: true` / no `additionalProperties` set

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Thing:
      type: object
      required:
        - id
      properties:
        id:
          type: integer
      # implicit additionalProperties: true
```

Will generate:

```go
// Thing defines model for Thing.
type Thing struct {
	Id int `json:"id"`
}

// with no generated boilerplate nor the `AdditionalProperties` field
```

### Explicit `additionalProperties: true`

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Thing:
      type: object
      required:
        - id
      properties:
        id:
          type: integer
      # explicit true
      additionalProperties: true
```

Will generate:

```go
// Thing defines model for Thing.
type Thing struct {
	Id                   int                    `json:"id"`
	AdditionalProperties map[string]interface{} `json:"-"`
}

// with generated boilerplate below
```

<details>

<summary>Boilerplate</summary>

```go

// Getter for additional properties for Thing. Returns the specified
// element and whether it was found
func (a Thing) Get(fieldName string) (value interface{}, found bool) {
	if a.AdditionalProperties != nil {
		value, found = a.AdditionalProperties[fieldName]
	}
	return
}

// Setter for additional properties for Thing
func (a *Thing) Set(fieldName string, value interface{}) {
	if a.AdditionalProperties == nil {
		a.AdditionalProperties = make(map[string]interface{})
	}
	a.AdditionalProperties[fieldName] = value
}

// Override default JSON handling for Thing to handle AdditionalProperties
func (a *Thing) UnmarshalJSON(b []byte) error {
	object := make(map[string]json.RawMessage)
	err := json.Unmarshal(b, &object)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	if raw, found := object["id"]; found {
		err = json.Unmarshal(raw, &a.Id)
		if err != nil {
			return fmt.Errorf("error reading 'id': %w", err)
		}
		delete(object, "id")
	}

	if len(object) != 0 {
		a.AdditionalProperties = make(map[string]interface{})
		for fieldName, fieldBuf := range object {
			var fieldVal interface{}
			err := json.Unmarshal(fieldBuf, &fieldVal)
			if err != nil {
				return fmt.Errorf("error unmarshaling field %s: %w", fieldName, err)
			}
			a.AdditionalProperties[fieldName] = fieldVal
		}
	}
	return nil
}

// Override default JSON handling for Thing to handle AdditionalProperties
func (a Thing) MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error) {
	var err error
	object := make(map[string]json.RawMessage)

	object["id"], err = json.Marshal(a.Id)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("error marshaling 'id': %w", err)
	}

	for fieldName, field := range a.AdditionalProperties {
		object[fieldName], err = json.Marshal(field)
		if err != nil {
			return nil, fmt.Errorf("error marshaling '%s': %w", fieldName, err)
		}
	}
	return json.Marshal(object)
}
```

### `additionalProperties` as `integer`s

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Thing:
      type: object
      required:
        - id
      properties:
        id:
          type: integer
      # simple type
      additionalProperties:
        type: integer
```

Will generate:

```go
// Thing defines model for Thing.
type Thing struct {
	Id                   int            `json:"id"`
	AdditionalProperties map[string]int `json:"-"`
}

// with generated boilerplate below
```

	if a.AdditionalProperties == nil {

	a.AdditionalProperties[fieldName] = value
}

// Override default JSON handling for Thing to handle AdditionalProperties
func (a *Thing) UnmarshalJSON(b []byte) error {
	object := make(map[string]json.RawMessage)
	err := json.Unmarshal(b, &object)

	}

	}

	if len(object) != 0 {

		for fieldName, fieldBuf := range object {
			var fieldVal int
			err := json.Unmarshal(fieldBuf, &fieldVal)
			if err != nil {

		}
	}
	return nil
}

// Override default JSON handling for Thing to handle AdditionalProperties
func (a Thing) MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error) {
	var err error
	object := make(map[string]json.RawMessage)

### `additionalProperties` with an object

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Thing:
      type: object
      required:
        - id
      properties:
        id:

      # object
      additionalProperties:
        type: object
        properties:
          foo:
            type: string
```

The [examples directory](examples) contains some additional cases which are useful examples 
for how to use `oapi-codegen`, including how you'd take the Petstore API and implement it 
with `oapi-codegen`.


## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### How does `oapi-codegen` handle `anyOf`, `allOf` and `oneOf`?

`oapi-codegen` supports `anyOf`, `allOf` and `oneOf` for generated code.

For instance, through the following OpenAPI spec:

```yaml
openapi: "3.0.0"
info:
  version: 1.0.0
  title: Using complex schemas
  description: An example of `anyOf`, `allOf` and `oneOf`
components:
  schemas:
    # base types
    Client:
      type: object
      required:
        - name
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
    Identity:
      type: object
      required:
        - issuer
      properties:
        issuer:
          type: string

    # allOf performs a union of all types defined
    ClientWithId:
      allOf:
        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Client'
        - properties:
            id:
              type: integer
          required:
            - id

    # allOf performs a union of all types defined, but if there's a duplicate field defined, it'll be overwritten by the last schema
    # https://github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen/issues/1569
    IdentityWithDuplicateField:
      allOf:
        # `issuer` will be ignored
        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Identity'
        # `issuer` will be ignored
        - properties:
            issuer:
              type: integer
        # `issuer` will take precedence
        - properties:
            issuer:
              type: object
              properties:
                name:
                  type: string
              required:
                - name

    # anyOf results in a type that has an `AsClient`/`MergeClient`/`FromClient` and an `AsIdentity`/`MergeIdentity`/`FromIdentity` method so you can choose which of them you want to retrieve
    ClientAndMaybeIdentity:
      anyOf:
        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Client'
        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Identity'

    # oneOf results in a type that has an `AsClient`/`MergeClient`/`FromClient` and an `AsIdentity`/`MergeIdentity`/`FromIdentity` method so you can choose which of them you want to retrieve
    ClientOrIdentity:
      oneOf:
        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Client'
        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Identity'
```

This results in the following types:

```go

### How can I ignore parts of the spec I don't care about?

By default, `oapi-codegen` will generate everything from the specification.

If you'd like to reduce what's generated, you can use one of a few options 
in [the configuration file](#usage) to tune the generation of the resulting output:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/doordash/oapi-codegen/HEAD/configuration-schema.json
filter:
  include:
    paths: []
    tags: []
    operation-ids: []
    schema-properties:
    extensions: []
  exclude:
    operation-ids: []
```
