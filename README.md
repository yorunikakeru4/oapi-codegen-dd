# `oapi-codegen`

[![OpenSSF Best Practices](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/9450/badge)](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/9450)

> **Battle-tested**: This generator is continuously tested against 2,000+ real-world OpenAPI specs, successfully generating and compiling over 20 million lines of Go code. Handles complex specs with circular references, deep nesting, and union types.

Using `oapi-codegen` allows you to reduce the boilerplate required to create or integrate with
services based on [OpenAPI 3.x](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.0.md), and instead focus on writing your business logic, and working
on the real value-add for your organization.

## Features

### Code Generation
- **Idiomatic Go code** - Clean, readable generated code that follows Go conventions
- **OpenAPI 3.x support** - Comprehensive support for OpenAPI 3.0 and 3.1 specifications
- **Flexible output** - Single or multiple file output with configurable structure
- **Smart pruning** - Automatically removes unused types by default (configurable)

### Type System
- **Union types** - Full support for `oneOf`, `anyOf`, and `allOf` with intelligent type merging and `runtime.Either[A, B]` for two-element unions
- **Additional properties** - Handle dynamic fields with `map[string]interface{}` or custom types
- **Validation** - Built-in validation using [go-playground/validator](https://github.com/go-playground/validator) with `Validate()` methods on generated types
- **Custom extensions** - for fine-grained control over code generation

### Client Generation
- **HTTP client generation** - Generate type-safe HTTP clients with customizable timeout and request editors
- **Custom client types** - Wrap generated clients with your own types for additional functionality
- **Error mapping** - Map response types to implement the `error` interface automatically

### Server Generation
- **Complete server scaffolding** - Generate service interfaces, HTTP adapters, routers, and server main.go
- **12 framework support** - Chi, Echo, Gin, Fiber, std-http, Beego, go-zero, Kratos, GoFrame, Hertz, gorilla-mux, fasthttp
- **Clean architecture** - Service interface pattern separates business logic from HTTP handling
- **Request/response validation** - Optional validation in generated handlers

### Configuration & Filtering
- **YAML-based configuration** with JSON schema validation
- **Flexible filtering** - Include/exclude by paths, tags, operation IDs, schema properties, or extensions
- **Transitive pruning** - Automatically remove schemas that are only referenced by filtered-out properties

### Programmatic Access
- **Runtime package** - Public API for working with generated types
- **TypeTracker** - Internal API for managing type definitions programmatically (for advanced use cases)

## Quick Start
```bash
# Install
go install github.com/doordash-oss/oapi-codegen-dd/v3/cmd/oapi-codegen@latest

# Generate code from the Petstore example
oapi-codegen https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/main/examples/v3.0/petstore.yaml > petstore.go
```

## Examples
The [examples directory](examples) contains cases with useful examples how to use `oapi-codegen`.


## Migrate from v2
This project is a fork of [oapi-codegen](https://github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen) v2.
Due to the lack of OpenAPI 3.1 support in the original repository, we introduced a fully reworked implementation.
While this includes some breaking changes, it also brings more flexible generator and parser APIs for finer control over code generation.
If you're migrating from v2, please refer to the [migration guide](https://doordash-oss.github.io/oapi-codegen-dd/migrate-from-v2/) for important differences.
